I chose to study at Howard because I want to be the first one in my family to obtain a bachelor’s degree. I also want to network with black students and give back to my community. Howard is one of the top coed private HBCUs and I worked hard to get accepted into this prestigious college, such as becoming the president of the Black Student Union in my high school, participating in events for career interest, and joining non-profit organizations for male empowerment. Through my creative ideas to bring minority students together, such as starting open mics and having open discussions about “Black Lives Matter”, the Black Student Union was one of the most socially conscious clubs on campus during my senior year of high school. I have also joined Howard University’s chapter of National Society of Black Engineers. Being a part of this club has helped strengthen my interest in computer science and network with engineering students Lastly, I was involved in organizations for African-American male empowerment, such as “Rites of Passage”. This non-profit organization founded by African-American men had a goal to improve the lives of young black males. Unlike other programs that I have participated in, “Rites of Passage” assisted me in finding my voice and true character. Once a month, we would meet to discuss what it meant to be a successful black man. As a result of my participation in this program, I have matured greatly; furthermore, I have volunteered several times for my community. As a student at Howard University, I will continue to be a tremendous asset because I will abide by the principles of manhood. I will continue to excel academically as a computer science major to become the successful black man that makes a positive difference in the lives of others.
