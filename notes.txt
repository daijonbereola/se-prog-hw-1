requirements:
 - no words should pass right margin
 - words should start past left margin
 - word = any sequence of non-blank characters
 - 1 blank b/w words, 2 blanks b/w sentences
 - output name = "DAT1.txt"
 - input = filename (str)
 - lm (int)
 - rm (int)
 
assumptions:
 - 1 line = 80 characters
 - 1 marginal indent (inch) = 6 blank space char
 - left and right margin are positive integers
 - output is 1 paragraph
 - total margin length < line length
 
algorithm:
 - declare line length
 - declare in margin length
 - open file (input)
 - open output file ("DAT1.txt")
 - get margin integers
 - calculate remaining line length, given margins
 - read in words from input file
 - store words in list
 - for words in list
   - add word to formatted string
   - subtract word length from line length
   - move runoff words to next line
 - close both files
